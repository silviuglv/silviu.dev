title: Best Practices for CI/CD in Modern Web Applications

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential for modern web applications, enabling teams to deliver updates quickly and reliably. Implementing CI/CD correctly can improve developer productivity, reduce bugs, and enhance the overall user experience.

```typescript
export async function getMdx<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(
  source: string
): Promise<MDXContent<T> | null> {
  const [path] = await glob(source);
  if (!path) return null;

  return await getMdxFromPath<T>(path);
}

export type BlogPostFrontmatter = {
  title: string;
  date: string;
};
```

## 1. Automate Everything

Automation is the core of CI/CD. From testing to deployment, every step should be automated to minimize human error. Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI to automate:

- Code linting and formatting
- Running unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Building and packaging the application
- Deployments to staging and production

## 2. Use Feature Flags for Safe Deployments

Feature flags allow you to roll out new features gradually without redeploying the entire application. This enables A/B testing, controlled releases, and quick rollbacks if needed. Tools like [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) or [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) can help manage feature flags efficiently.

## 3. Implement a Multi-Stage Pipeline

Separate your CI/CD pipeline into different stages to ensure a smooth deployment process:

- **Development:** Code is tested in an isolated environment.
- **Staging:** A replica of production where final testing occurs.
- **Production:** The live environment where the application runs.

This separation ensures that only thoroughly tested code reaches production.

## 4. Optimize Test Execution

Testing is crucial, but long test suites slow down deployments. Optimize test execution by:

- Running unit tests first before integration and end-to-end tests.
- Parallelizing test execution to speed up feedback.
- Using test containers to ensure consistency across environments.

## 5. Implement Rollbacks and Monitoring

Even with rigorous testing, issues can arise. Implement rollback mechanisms such as:

- **Blue-green deployments** for zero-downtime rollbacks.
- **Canary deployments** to release features to a small group before a full rollout.

Additionally, use monitoring tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), or [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) to track application performance and detect failures early.

## Conclusion

CI/CD is a game-changer for modern web applications, but it must be implemented thoughtfully. Automate everything, use feature flags, optimize testing, and have a solid rollback strategy to ensure smooth, fast, and reliable deployments.
