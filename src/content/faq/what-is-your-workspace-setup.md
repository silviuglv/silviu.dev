question: What is your developer workspace setup?
---

I've been a Mac user since 2016 and I'll never go back to Windows. Apart from that I like to keep things simple and streamlined.

### IDE/Editor

For coding I use VSCode, here's my configuration:

- **Theme**: Operator Mono Dark;
- **Font**: Operator Mono;
- **Copilot**: [Amazon Q](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amazonwebservices.amazon-q-vscode);

#### Essential Extensions

- [AWS ToolKit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amazonwebservices.aws-toolkit-vscode)
- [Console Ninja](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.console-ninja)
- [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [GitBlame](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waderyan.gitblame)
- [GitHub Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.vscode-github-actions)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YoavBls.pretty-ts-errors)

### Productivity tools

For daily organization, I rely on the **Notes** app on macOS. It’s perfect for simple note-taking and checklists — which I use every morning to outline my goals and break my work into manageable tasks.
