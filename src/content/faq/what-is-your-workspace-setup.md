question: What is your developer workspace setup?
---

I've been a Mac user since 2016 and I'll never go back to Windows. Apart from that I would say my setup is pretty basic as I like to keep things simple:

#### IDE/Editor:

I use VSCode, here's the setup:

- **Theme**: Operator Mono Dark;
- **Font**: Operator Mono;
- **Copilot**: [Amazon Q](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amazonwebservices.amazon-q-vscode);
- **Extensions**: [AWS ToolKit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amazonwebservices.aws-toolkit-vscode), [Console Ninja](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.console-ninja), [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv), [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [GitBlame](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waderyan.gitblame), [GitHub Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.vscode-github-actions), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YoavBls.pretty-ts-errors)

#### Productivity tools:

I like to use **Notes** which is a MacOS app with pretty basic note taking functionality.

It allows you to add checklists which I use every morning to outline what I want to achieve for the day or to split a working session into smaller tasks.
